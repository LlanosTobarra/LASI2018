# Workshop Data analysis with Elasticsearch and Kibana
LASI 2018 - 18-19 June León

The following repository contains materials for the Workshop 

## Initial instructions

The basic platform for Windows computers can be downloaded from the following link: https://goo.gl/utXp5v
You need to have installed lasted version of Java Software Developers Kit. You can obtained from the following link:
If you prefer install everything from zero at the docs folders there is a setup.pdf with details.

There is an alternative option for non-Windows systems using docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/sebp/elkx/). Instructions to deploy the composed container are detailed in the web. Once the composed docker is running there are several python scripts in each example folder in order to load data inside Elasticsearch.

## Datasets 


First dataset is based on xAPI data dedicated to predict student's academic performance. More data about this dataset can be found in the following articles:
